        <h2>What is a Cat?</h2>
        <p>
            The domestic cat is now the world’s most popular pet, but catswere not always<br>
            tame. The relationship between humans and cats began in the Near East about<br>
            10,000 years ago, when cats killed the rodents that ate  grain stored in towns<br>
            and villages. They were kept as pets in Egypt from about 2000 BCE, but the<br>
            different breeds have only been created over the last hundred years or so.</p>

        <h3>Cat Breeds</h3>
        <p>
            In the late 19th century the breeding and showing of cats began in earnest, and<br>
            cat enthusiasts became known as “cat fanciers.” Cat registries were established<br>
            to set breed standards and to store the genealogies of purebred cats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, there are several international cat registries, and more than 100 different<br>
            cat breeds, though not all registries recognize the same ones. Breeds are defined<br>
            by characteristics such as body and head shape; coat color and pattern; eye shape<br>
            and color; and temperament; as well as by unusual features such as  hairlessness,<br>
            short tails, and folded ears. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dk.com/uk/book/9781409350033-the-complete-cat-breed-book/">*</a>
