            Welcome! 🐱🐶
        </p>
        <p>
            Petlopedia is a pet encyclopedia for pet enthusiasts!

            Pets have become an indispensable part of our lives throughout history. They <br>
            are members of our families, our most beloved ones, and our babies. As their <br>
            companion, we are always trying to learn more about them, explore their <br>
            mysterious world, and be the best partner we can be for them.
        </p>

        

        <p>
            I am Hulya Martli, an animal lover who is always fascinated with learning <br>
            more about our companions' world. I always try to keep up with the latest <br>
            pet info and learn how to best communicate with them. I wanted to share this <br>
            knowledge, and therefore I created Petlopedia. You can learn more about our <br>
            most beloved friends' species history, breeds, behaviors, and much more here!
